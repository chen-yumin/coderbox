## Introduction

[CoderBox][coderbox] is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed by developers for developers. It contains common dev tools needed for day-to-day coding environment.

This application is built using [Ionic Framework][ionic] (with [Angular][angular]). The backend server application is built with [Express][express], which can be found in the [./server](./server) folder.

## Setup

Before you can run this application, you need to install [Node.js][nodejs].

To install the projectâ€™s dependencies, run

    npm install

## Running locally

To run the [Ionic][ionic] app locally where any change in the source code will automatically get compiled and reflected:

    npm start

This will start a local server on port 4200. Open [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/) to view your app in the browser.

To run the [Express][express] server app locally, run:

    npm run start:server

This will build the [Ionic][ionic] app into a PWA and start the [Express][express] backend app locally in *development* mode to serve it.

## Building for production

If you want to build this project for production, run:

    npm run build

This will build [Ionic][ionic] application to the [./server/www](./server/www) folder.

To build the [Express][express] server application for production, run:

    npm run build:server

If you'd like to run the application locally in *production* mode after the build succeeds, you can run:

    npm run start:prod

## Testing

To run the tests locally:

    npm test

Continuous Integration (CI) with [CircleCI][circleci] is used to automate the testing workflows. Every code push triggers automatic building and testing. See [.circleci/config.yml](.circleci/config.yml) for detailed configuration.

## Deploying

To deploy the [Node.js][nodejs] server application to [Google App Engine][gae], you can run:

    npm run deploy

Continuous Deployment (CD) with [CircleCI][circleci] is used to automate the deployment workflows. See [.circleci/config.yml](.circleci/config.yml) for detailed configuration.
